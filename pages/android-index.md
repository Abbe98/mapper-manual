The Mapper app for Android
==========================

The Android version of OpenOrienteering Mapper is not as self-descriptive as
the desktop version, so please read this first for important instructions.
 
**Note:** The OpenOrienteering Mapper user wiki contains an
          [online version of this documentation](http://sourceforge.net/p/oorienteering/wiki/Android Manual).
          It may contain additions and corrections.
