<h3>Map screen</h3>
<p>This is the main window when drawing maps. By default it looks similar to this:</p>

<br/><br/><img src="images/main_window.png" border="0" /><br/><br/>

<p>The <b>toolbars</b> at the top provide access to the drawing tools, among others. See the <a href="toolbars.html">list of all toolbar elements</a>.</p>

<p>In the middle, the currently opened <b>map</b> is displayed.</p>

<p>On the right, a list of all <b>symbols</b> in the currently opened map file is shown. See <a href="symbol_dock_widget.html">symbols</a>.</p>

<p>On the bottom, there is the <b>status bar</b> which shows useful information about the usage of the currently active tool. Just by reading these tips, you can learn a lot about the drawing tools without reading this manual.</p>

<p>You can rearrange the position of the toolbars and the symbol pane as you wish by dragging them to the desired location.</p>
