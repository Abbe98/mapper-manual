<h3>FAQ</h3>

<h4>Navigation</h4>

<p><b>How do I move the map?</b><br/>
The easiest way is to hold the middle mouse button while moving the mouse. But you can also press F6 and move the mouse, or use the corresponding toolbar button.</p>

<p><b>How to zoom in and out?</b><br/>
You can use the mouse wheel, if you have one, press F7 / F8. There are also zoom buttons in the toolbar.</p>


<h4>Drawing</h4>

<!--<p><b>I want to start drawing a map, but have no idea how to.</b><br/>
Start by reading the <a href="mapping/index.html">short introduction to o-mapping</a>.</p>-->

<p><b>How do I add points to an existing path or delete points from it?</b><br/>
With the path object selected using the edit tool, hold Ctrl and click a free spot on the path to create a new point there. You can even move the mouse in the same action to set the position of the new point. To delete a point, hold Ctrl and click an existing point.</p>

<p><b>How do I change line segments from curved to straight and vice versa?</b><br/>
With the <a href="toolbars.html#tool_edit_line">line edit tool</a>, select the object you want to edit and hold Ctrl while clicking the line segment. This switches the segment between curved and straight.

<h4>File formats</h4>

<p><b>What are the advantages of the .omap format?</b><br/>
The .omap format is OpenOrienteering Mapper's native format. It is XML-based, which means for example that it is relatively easy for other developers to access the information in map files. Additionally, it is platform independent, error-resistant and makes it possible to keep a high compatibility between different versions of the format.</p>

<p><b>Can Mapper read and write .ocd files?</b><br/>
Yes, but currently only .ocd files of version 8 are supported. Furthermore, some inaccuracies might occur when saving / loading .ocd files.</p>


<h4>Mobile devices</h4>

<p><b>Will Mapper be available for iPhone / iPad?</b><br/>
Probably not.</p>

<p><b>Will Mapper be available for Android?</b><br/>
An Android version is planned, however it cannot be said when it will be ready yet.</p>
