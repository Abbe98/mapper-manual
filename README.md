This repository is the source of the OpenOrienteering Mapper User Manual.
It is online at http://openorienteering.github.io/mapper-manual/, and
it is merged into the released software packages.

# Information for contributors

The manual pages are in Markdown format, with some extensions.
HTML is supported, too.

Don't edit files outside the pages directory.
Don't put to much effort in fancy formatting.
The manual is published through [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) online and
through [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) for the packaged
offline version. Only a subset of Markdown, Jekyll and Doxygen features are
available for both publishing paths.
